Simple app which allows users to receive a rough currency conversion with the option of adding a bank fee.
Offlineable - uses AJAX to get ECB rates from XML feed then saves these locally, uses local rates for the calculator and works offline with no network access (updating the rates only when the page/app is loaded (if thereâ€™s a network).
Local storage keeps users previously selected home, foreign currency and bank fee configuration.
Includes home page icon, full screen launching, easy to navigate dynamic sidebar and effective styling.
Graphical currency selection using flags of desired country.
